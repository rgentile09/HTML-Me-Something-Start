            <li>LaunchCode</li>

         <p>In January of 2024, I began my journey into the field of Tech, by getting accepted into LaunchCode and
            started a class on Javascript. Although
            this is when I started learning to code with a career in tech in mind, it was not the first time I had
            thought about making this move.
            I grew up fascinated by computers and began learning at an early age about how they worked from my mom. She
            worked at the IT desk at Washington University,
            and taught me much about computers. We even built our personal computer together at home.</p>
         <p>As I grew older, and technology advanced rapidly, I was unable to keep up with technology as I graduated
            high school and went to college. There were so
            many other things to learn and do that I basically stopped thinking about a computer career altogether. It
            wasn't until about 6 years ago that I started
            to again think about a career change.

         <h5>Personal Life &amp; Hobbies</h5>
         <P class="funParagraph">I enjoy spending time with my wife and 3 children. We love playing outside, going to
            the park, and enjoying some of the many activities to do around St. Louis.
            I also enjoy playing golf, going to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nNEb2k_EmMg" target="_blank">Blues </a>and <a href="https://www.mlb.com/cardinals" target="_blank">Cardinals </a> games, hiking and enjoying nature.
            <br>Here are a few of our favorite spots in St. Louis to visit:
         <ol>
            
            <li>The St. Louis Zoo</li>
            <br>
            <img src="./Images/hair-and-fur.png"/>
            <li>The Aquarium</li>
            <br>
            <img src="./Images/aqaurium_otter.png" width="200" height="200"/>
            <li>Missouri Botanical Gardens</li>
            <br>
            <img src="./Images/mo_botan.jpg" width="200" height="200"/>
            <li>Powder Valley Conservation Nature Center</li>
            <br>
            <img src="./Images/powder_valley.jpeg" width="200" height="200"/>

         </ol>
         We also love to travel, and our favorite place to be is Hawaii. We have been to the islands several times and
         we hope to move there in the near future.
         Ultimately, this goal of ours has been a driving factor in my pursuit of a career in tech.
